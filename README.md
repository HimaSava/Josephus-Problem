# Josephus-Problem

Josephus Problem is an old mathematical riddle. 

Though it is well explained in many other sources I will try my best to explain it here.

## The Problem:
41 soliders were surrounded by the enemy troups. They all agread that death is better than getting captured, but they didn't want to commit sucide. So they sat in a circle. They agreed that the first person will kill the person to his right. The next person will again kill the person to his right and this continues till only 1 person is alive. Then that one person will have to commit sucide.

Josephus was one among those 41 soliders, but he prefered to get captured than die. He couldn't tell this to his comarades otherwise they may kill him. The only way he could stay alive was to be the last man alive. Find what position does Josephus need to be in so that he is the last man alive?

Though this riddle has a fixed 41 soldiers, mathematically it is interesting to solve this problem for when there are x soldiers. For that I have made the program that manually caluculates and finds the position just by the rules above.

Also wikipedia has a good article on it
